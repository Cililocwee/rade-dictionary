      <h1>About</h1>
      <p>
        The Rade language is a language spoken by the Rade (Rade, Ede, or Rhade)
        people of the Central Highlands of Vietnam{" "}
      </p>
      <p>
        There are currently over 300k native speakers of Rade in Vietnam, with
        thousands more scattered aroudn the globe.
      </p>
      <p>
        The purpose of this website is to maintain an easily accessible
        repository of the Rade language, as resources for the language are few
        and far between.
      </p>
      <p>
        The main language on this site will be English, though I hope to
        incorprate a Rade edition in the future.
      </p>
      <h3>Future updates will focus on: </h3>

      <ul>
        <li>Increasing the database of words</li>
        <li>Adding Vietnamese language support</li>
        <li>
          Adding additional language support for learning about the Rade
          language and culture
        </li>
      </ul>
